# Task 2: Create and Back-test your own trading strategy

Let your creativity run free! 
Use any data you need. This could include trading data from exchanges (e.g.: FTX, Binance, etc.), but also non-trading data.
Create a trading strategy (e.g. Pairs Trading, Cash and Carry, Market Making, Momentum, etc.), optimize, and backtest it.
Please be as accurate as possible: 
- include trading costs;
- avoid look-ahead bias;
- in-sample and out-of-the-sample results

And then present it!

**NOTE**: we are not expecting a money-making machine. We want to see if you can test your ideas, even if they are not successful. The way you explain your findings is the key.
