## Project description
In this assessment you have to prove your data science skills. 
You can solve the problems in your chosen programming language and also work with existing packages.
We expect as a final product:
1. A **Report with the results** (in the format you prefer: e.g. PDF, GitHub, PPT, Word, HTML, etc.)
2. An elegant and working **code** (commented properly!). At best, we are able to run the code and obtain your same results without applying **any** change.

**P.S.** 
- we love plots, charts and graphics.
- we prefer 100% of 90% than 90% of 100%.

You have 24 hours to solve this assessment and send the report, your code to [principaltrading@cryptofinance.ch](mailto:principaltrading@cryptofinance.ch). 
If the results are larger than 15MB, please send us the download link to the project folder (i.e. GitHub, Dropbox, Drive, etc.).

You should be able to solve the assessment on your own, but feel free to reach us out **in case you have questions in the first 2 hours**.
